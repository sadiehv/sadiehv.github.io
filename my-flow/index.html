    <h1>Hi! In this website I will talk about my flow. :)</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>My flow is something I can do and get so engrossed in, I lose track of time.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>My biggest flow activity right now is <b>playing guitar!</b></p>

    <p> where I learned to play shrike!</p>
    <p>Here are some important skills to keep in mind while playing guitar:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep your fingers arched to avoid pressing on the wrong strings</li>
        <li>Have good posture and keep the guitar facing outward instead of turning it to look</li>
        <li>Keep your thumb in the middle of the neck (this one is hard for me)</li>

    </ul>
