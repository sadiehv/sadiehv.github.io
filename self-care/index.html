    <h2>My Self Care Website :)</h2>

    <p>In this website, I want to provide a place for myself to revisit in times of stress. It will be full of my favorite things, images, media, and memories to come back to in times when I could use self-care. I think self care is a combination of having
        healthy habits and being kind to yourself, so hopefully this website can be a reminder to me when I need comfort! Thanks!</p>
